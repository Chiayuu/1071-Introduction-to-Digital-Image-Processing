 System of linear equations of two unknowns

 **ideas (System of linear equations of two unknowns)**	
$$
a1x + b1y = c1\\
 a2x + b2y = c2
$$

 For two equations above, we can know that the solutions is related to it's coefficient from Cramer's rule. 

 Cramer's rule show that ：
$$
 x = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}c1 & b1\\\\c2 & b2\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}a1 & b1\\\\a2 & b2\end{vmatrix}} \quad\quad y = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}a1 & c1\\\\a2 & c2\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}a1 & b1\\\\a2 & b2\end{vmatrix}}
$$
 and it can find the solution.

 we can also know the status of System of equations of two unknowns by the coefficient.

 **status 1 one solution**

 slopes are not equal.
$$
\frac{a1}{b1} \neq \frac{a2}{b2}	**status 2 infinitely many solutions**
$$

 **status 2 infinitely many solutions**

slopes and y-intercept are equal.
$$
 -\frac{a1}{b1} = -\frac{a2}{b2}\quad\quad\frac{c1}{b1} = \frac{c2}{b2}
$$
 ​	

 **status 3 no solution**

 slopes are equal, but y-intercept are not equal.
$$
-\frac{a1}{b1} = -\frac{a2}{b2}\quad\quad\frac{c1}{b1} \neq \frac{c2}{b2}
$$


At last, we can know the solutions and the status.

​	Use the tool "shape" in VB6, and use it's function backcolor.

​	Using this function we need three parameters, which are red value, green value and blue value.

​	Make those value connected to the text box which you can enter different number.

​	Make the text box connected to the scroll.

​	And if we change the number of the box, the scroll will change together.
